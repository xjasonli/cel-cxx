FFI bindings for the [cel-cxx](https://crates.io/crates/cel-cxx) crate.

This crate provides low-level FFI bindings to [google/cel-cpp](https://github.com/google/cel-cpp) 
using the [cxx](https://crates.io/crates/cxx) crate for safe interop. It is primarily intended 
for internal use by the `cel-cxx` crate and is not recommended for direct use.

## Features

- **Safe C++ interop** via the `cxx` crate
- **Zero-cost abstractions** for CEL-CPP integration
- **Type-safe bindings** for CEL values, expressions, and environments
- **Memory management** with proper RAII patterns
- **Error handling** with Rust-native error types

## Usage

This crate is automatically included when you use `cel-cxx`. You typically don't need to 
depend on it directly.

```toml
[dependencies]
cel-cxx = "0.2.0"  # This includes cel-cxx-ffi automatically
```

If you need to use the low-level bindings directly:

```toml
[dependencies]
cel-cxx-ffi = "0.2.0"
```

## Build Requirements

- **C++17 compatible compiler**
- **Bazel** (automatically managed by cel-build-utils)
- **Google CEL-CPP** (automatically downloaded and built)
